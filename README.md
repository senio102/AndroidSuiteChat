# AndroidSuiteChat
James Senior

This application uses a java TCP client running on an android device to connect to an outside server.
As of this release, the application currently has the ability to take an IP address and port number from the user and send a connection request.
The user can then chat from the client running on the phone to another client on another phone/machine.
The client uses threads for the ability to send and recieve messages simultaneously.
The server also has the ability to handle more than one client at once using multiple threads.

The application has too many files to upload them all to Githib, although i have posted screenshots and the main java files i worked on.
The APK file is also available to download and run via a desktop application such as BlueStacks or Android Studio.

To run the application, open it via an emulator and run the server in a terminal window.

If doing both on the same machine, when prompted for the IP address at the application screen, enter 10.0.2.2

The port is set to 4252 by deault on the server side, but it can be changed.
